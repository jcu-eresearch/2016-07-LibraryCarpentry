  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on, **Library Carpentry** workshop 
  will cover basic concepts and tools, including regular expressions, 
  recommended data structures, version control, task automation, and data clean up. 
  The datasets used for analysis during the workshop will be relevant to librarians. 
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have 
  learned to their own research problems. This workshop is based on the 
  <a href="https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry">Library Carpentry</a> curriculum intitally
  developed by Dr James Baker.
